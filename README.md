# F1Dash
Codemaster's F1 2016 UDP Telemetry System for Raspberry Pi

A small project to use a Raspberry Pi [2 or 3] as a device to display telemetry data from Codemaster's F1 2016.

The project is written in Python 2.7.x using Pygame.

The project has been built with a small LCD panel in mind, driven by a Raspberry Pi which can be installed in a gaming seat and wheel rig.   The project is not being designed to make full use of a typical display screen.  Although it is hope with time the project will grow to support more display options.

Final notes from the author,
This is the first major undertaking and so coding mistakes and poor structure may exist.
Apologizes in advance.

Have... fun!
